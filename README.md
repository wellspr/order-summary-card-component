## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

As I complete this challenge, I can see clearly that writing semantic html is much more than choosing among some fancy tags. I understood that semantic html and accessibility are closely related. 


### Useful resources

- [https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/how-build-card-component](https://www.mediacurrent.com/blog/how-build-card-component) - This is a great reference that helps understand the problem of building a card component using semantic html.

- [https://www.thisdot.co/blog/make-it-accessible-better-layout-with-html](https://www.thisdot.co/blog/make-it-accessible-better-layout-with-html) - This is also a great resource, in which the concept of accessibility is put at the center of the discussion, making clear the fundamental importance of a semantic markup for accessible html documents.
